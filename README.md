# ArchCiggies
A lightweight &amp; portable Arch ISO environment.

***

# WARNING: Pre-compiled releases have stopped as of version 221221. It's became too much of a hassle.

***

## Prerequisites
- A USB drive and a way to flash it (Etcher works just fine) **Don't use Ventoy or similar tools.**
- (for ISO building) an Arch-based system already deployed with archiso

***

## Using pre-built ISO images
Flash the ISO to a USB drive, then boot to it. You'll need to disable Secure Boot for this as of now. You can log into the root account by just using the "root" username, as there is no password for it.

As of 221221, you can enter an ArchTitties environment by running `./ArchTitties`.

For 151221, you can enter an ArchTitties environment by entering the archtitties directory, then running `./ArchTitties.`

## Why is it called ArchCiggies?
Also purely for comedic value. It isn't an acronym for anything, I just thought it was memorable. Also another suggested name.

## What can ArchCiggies do?
Provide a base environment where you can install Arch from, or use as a recovery environment, or to have a non-persistent install. The world is yours, go take it.

## What can it not do?
It can't do anything a regular Arch Linux ISO can't.

## Is it just you that works on ArchCiggies, 4rotr?
Yes, for now.
